This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

This the socendary market place where I'm trying connect customer with shopkeeper. You have to buy shopkeeper authorities so that you can post your secondary mobile phone to sell.
A customer will be able see the all mobile phones listed on market with images and details. After booking will be only for cenrten time span if customer didn't buy phone mobile will be available for booking again.
I have to added some more features.
